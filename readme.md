## Intro

As is notoriously known, interaction based on natural language is usually ambiguous, making goal-oriented interactive tasks hard for robots to solve. Therefore, we collect 20K human-to-human disambiguation dialogues based on the images filtered from OpenImages. 

## Download

- InVig dataset can be accessed from [ğŸ¤—jxu124/invig](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jxu124/invig).

    ```
    import datasets
    ds = datasets.load_datasets("jxu124/invig")
    ```

- Images (OpenImages datasets) can be accessed from [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html). 

- A list of image IDs (a filename list) used in the InViG dataset can be obtained through this python scripts

    ```
    import os
    import datasets

    ds = datasets.load_datasets("jxu124/invig")
    file_list = [os.path.basename(i)
        for split in ['train', 'test', 'validation']
            for i in ds[split]['image_path']
    ]
    ```
